% \textbf{Intellectual Merit:} 
% We will find an analytical estimate for the decay of error introduced by segmental refinement as a function of wave number and strength of the boundary value perturbation. Also, we will provide a software framework for limited memory hierarchical algorithms. 
% %analytical estimate for the decay of error away from the boundary as a function of the wave number and strength of the boundary value perturbation. introduced error decays away from boundary. we will provide a software framework for limited memory hierarchical algorithms. 

% \textbf{Broader Impact:}
% A pillar of my research would be the implementation of the algorithm in open-source form such that a researcher, even one outside of the field of mathematics, could use.This would make SRMG available to experts of fields outside of mathematics without access to a computational expert as a collaborator, who still need to compute solutions to large problems. The nature of the algorithm increases the scale of problems that our strongest supercomputers can solve, as well as the scale of problems solvable on a personal computer. This makes more problems accessible to all scales of researchers, from large organizations with access to supercomputers to individual researchers without access to these resources. 

%\textbf{Need: citation that software grows quickly, flops per unknown, problems solved with multigrid, }

%Consider a laptop capable of 10^9 operations per second. An upper estimate of the computational complexity of this problem is 500 to 10^2 operations required for each unknown. Consider 10% performance of computer. 10^2*10^12 10^(9) = 10^5 = 25 hours.
